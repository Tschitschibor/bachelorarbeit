# CatReps-Seminar

In this talk I give a short introduction in category theory, then define the
category of k-linear functors from an algebroid into the matrix category.
Using the CAP package CatReps I will demonstrate an algorithm for a direct sum decomposition of functors, and show Hom-based invariants to
distinguish between different representations.

## Build

### Seminarvortrag Bachelorarbeit

The LaTeX file `Seminarvortrag_Bachelorarbeit.tex` is self-contained with no dependencies, so all you need is a LaTeX compiler.

### CategoryOfRepresentations

The [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook `CategoryOfRepresentations.ipynb` demonstrates the functionality of the [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) package [CatReps](https://github.com/homalg-project/CatReps), which is based on the

* [homalg project](https://github.com/homalg-project/homalg_project/),
* [CAP project](https://github.com/homalg-project/CAP_project/).

These notebooks use the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) package [CapAndHomalg](https://github.com/homalg-project/CapAndHomalg.jl).
