\section{The categories Quiv, Cat, FinSets, k-Mat, CatReps and the Functor Category}
In this section, we first want to define the category \textbf{Quiv} and how it is the prototype for the category \textbf{Cats}.
We want to restrict ourselves to finite concrete categories, which brings us to the category \textbf{FinSets}. 
Our goal is to represent concrete categories, for this we need the source and target categories of our representations.
The source category is \textbf{k-Algebroids} which we compute algorithmically from a concrete category.
The target category of our category representations is \textbf{k-Mat}.
The category where our category representations lie in is \textbf{CatReps} for which we show that it's a subcategory of the
\textbf{Functor Category}.

\subsection{Additional structure on the Hom-set of a category}

\begin{example}
A group G defines a category BG with a single object. The group elements are its morphisms, which are all automorphisms of the single object.
The identity element $e \in G$ acts as the identity morphism for the unique object in this category. The hom-set of that category is itself
a group.
\end{example}

This example can be generalized to categories where the hom-set is a ring or an R-algebra. But for this we need a commutative ring R and thus
the category R-Mod.

\begin{definition}{Ab-Category}
An \ul{Ab-category} is a category in which all homomorphism sets are abelian groups. That means in addition to the composition
of morphisms \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small] \mu:\mathcal{C}_{1} \times \mathcal{C}_{1} \arrow[rr] &  & \mathcal{C}_{1}
\end{tikzcd} we have another binary operation \begin{tikzcd}[column sep=small] +:\mathcal{C}_{1} \times \mathcal{C}_{1} \arrow[rr] &  & \mathcal{C}_{1}
\end{tikzcd}, that distributes over the composition, i.e. \[\mu(f+g,h) = \mu(f,h)+\mu(g,h)\].
\end{definition}

The concept of a functor is central in category theory. It is how the objects and morphisms of two categories relate to one another.

\begin{definition}{(Functor)}\\
In the category \textbf{Cat} which has categories as objects, \ul{functors} are the morphisms between these objects.
Let $\mathcal{C},\mathcal{D} \in \textup{Obj}\,\textbf{Cat}$ be categories. A \ul{functor} \begin{tikzcd}
F: \mathcal{C} \arrow[r] & \mathcal{D}
\end{tikzcd} between $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ consists
of the following data:
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\theenumi)}
\begin{enumerate}
\item For every object $c \in \mathcal{C}_{0}$ there is an object $Fc \in \mathcal{D}$.
\item For every morphism $f \in \mathcal{C}_{1}$, i.e. \begin{tikzcd} c \arrow[r, "f"] & c' \end{tikzcd} there is a morphism
$Ff \in \mathcal{D}_{1}$ with \begin{tikzcd} Fc \arrow[r, "Ff"] & Fc' \end{tikzcd}, i.e. $s(Ff) = F\,s(f)$ and $t(Ff) = F\,t(f)$
\newcounter{saveenum}
\setcounter{saveenum}{\value{enumi}}
\end{enumerate}
Functors are compatible with the identity map and the composition map:
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{\value{saveenum}}
\item For every object $c \in \mathcal{C}_{0}$ we have $1_{c} \in \mathcal{C}_{1}$ and for the functor $F$ we demand that
$F\,1_{c} = 1_{Fc} \in \mathcal{D}_{1}$. 
\item For every pair of morphisms $f,g \in \mathcal{C}_{1}$ with $t(f) = s(g)$ we have $fg \in \mathcal{C}_{1}$ and we demand that
$Fg\,Fg = F\,gf$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

With the definition of a category and the category of functors finished, we can come back and use them to define the category of quivers
\textbf{Quiv}.

\begin{definition}{(The category \textbf{Quiv})}\cite{[4681]}
Let the \ul{Kronecker category} $\mathcal{K}$ be the category with two objects, $0$ and $1$, and two non-identity morphisms, s and t
\begin{tikzcd}
1 \arrow[r, "s", shift left] \arrow[r, "t"', shift right] & 0
\end{tikzcd}.
Let \textbf{FinSets} be the category of finite sets with morphisms being maps between those sets.
The \ul{category of quivers} \textbf{Quiv} is the category of functors from $\mathcal{K}$ to \textbf{FinSets}.
For a quiver $q \in \textup{Obj}\,\textbf{Quiv}$ we write $q_{x}$ for the image of $x \in \{0,1\}$ under $q$.
The images under $q$ of the morphisms $s$ and $t$ are again denoted by $s$ and $t$.
\end{definition}


\noindent As we have seen, every category is a quiver, but in general, to become a category, a quiver is lacking identity morphisms
and the composition of morphisms. To be more precise, there is a \ul{functor} $U$ from the \ul{category of categories} $\textup{CAT}$ to the
\ul{category of quivers} $\textup{Quiv}$, called the \ul{underlying quiver} or \ul{forgetful functor}.
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
\textup{Cat} \arrow[rr,"U"] &  & \textup{Quiv}
\end{tikzcd}
\]
mapping every object $M \in \mathcal{C}_{0}$ to the same objects in $q_{0}$, mapping every arrow $\varphi \in \mathcal{C}_{1}$ to 
an arrow $a \in q_{1}$, respecting source and target, but forgetting the special role of the identity morphisms and of the composition morphisms.

\noindent In the category on the left, associativity of composition guaranteed that $(\varphi\psi)\rho = \varphi(\psi\rho)$, so those two arrows
were already the same, so they are mapped to the same arrow $f = U((\varphi\psi)\rho) = U(\varphi(\psi\rho))$ in the quiver on the right.
We didn't have to draw both arrows for $f$, but since they are equal, there is still only one arrow in the hom-set $\textup{Hom}_{q}(1,4)=\{f,f\} = \{f\}$.\\
All the other identities are not preserved under the forgetful functor, e.g. $d$ doesn't know what it has to do with $a$ and $b$ apart from
$s(d) = s(a)$ and $t(d) = t(b)$. Especially the former identity arrows are now just endomorphisms with no defining property.\\
The paths $g^{2}f, gf$ and $fj^{3}$ are all different, while in the category, they all simplify to
$1_{A}1_{A}(\varphi\psi)\rho = 1_{A}(\varphi\psi)\rho = (\varphi\psi)\rho1_{D}1_{D}1_{D} =  (\varphi\psi)\rho$ due to the unit property and associativity.
\end{example}


\begin{definition}{(Ab-category)}
An \ul{Ab-category} is a category in which all homomorphism sets are abelian groups, and composition distributes over addition.\\
In other words,
A category $\mathcal{C}$ is an \ul{Ab-category} if for every pair of objects $M,N \in \mathcal{C}_{0}$, $( \textup{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(M,N), + )$ is
an abelian group (with the neutral element called \ul{zero morphism}), and for all morphisms $\gamma, \delta \in \textup{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(M,N),
\alpha, \beta \in \textup{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(N,L)$
\[
(\gamma + \delta)\alpha = \gamma\alpha + \delta\alpha \textup{ and }\]\[
\gamma(\alpha+\beta) = \gamma\alpha + \gamma\beta.
\]
Note that every hom-set has its own unique zero morphism. E.g. in $\textup{Mat}_{\mathbb{Q}}$ the 2-by-3 zero-matrix $0 \in \textup{Hom}(2,3)$ is different from
the 4-by-4 zero-matrix $0 \in \textup{Hom}(4,4)$.
