We are opening the valves that let the ocean stream into the rising sea on two sides:

On the one side describing the theory of algebroids that is the $\Bbbk$-linear closure of a finite concrete category.
On the other side of the ocean we fill in the theory of functor categores, especially the category of functors from
a $\Bbbk$-algebroid into the matrix category $\kmat$.

With the sea filled to the edge, describing the category of representations of a concrete category as a functor category
will be smooth sailing knowing the theoretical foundations below will carry us across.
