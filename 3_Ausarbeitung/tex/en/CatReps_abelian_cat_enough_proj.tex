Goal is to show that

The functor category with values in $\kmat$ is an Abelian category with enough projectives (constructively) and direct sum decomposition (constructively).

\subsection{Abelian category}

\begin{lemma}
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite-dimensional algebroid over some field $\Bbbk$. The functor category
\[
\HomAkmat
\]
is an Ab-category.
\begin{proof}
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\theenumi)}
\item Let $F, G \in \mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal{A},\kmat)$. We want to show that
$\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal{A},\kmat)}(F,G)$ is an abelian group.
We define the morphisms in $\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal{A},\kmat)_{1}$ as natural transformations
between the functors, i.e. a morphism $\eta F \Rightarrow G$ is defined by its components $\eta_{o}$ for each object $o \in \mathcal{A}$,
such that $G(o) = \eta_{o} F(o)$. Each $\eta_{o}$ is a morphism in $\kmat$, i.e. a matrix. And for these we already
showed that it's an abelian category, therefore $\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal{A},\kmat)}(F,G)$ is an abelian group.
\item The composition of two morphisms $\eta, \gamma \in \mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal{A},\kmat)_{1}$ 
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite-dimensional algebroid over some field $\Bbbk$. The functor category
\[
\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal{A},\kmat)
\]
is an additive category.
\begin{proof}
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\theenumi)}
\item It is an Ab-category, which we showed in \ref{}.
\item
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{lemma}
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite-dimensional algebroid over some field $\Bbbk$. The functor category
\[
\mathrm{Hom}(\mathcal{A},\kmat)
\]
is a pre-abelian category.
\begin{proof}
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\theenumi)}
\item It is an additive category, which we showed in \ref{}.
\item
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
\end{lemma}

\begin{theorem}
Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a finite-dimensional algebroid over some field $\Bbbk$. The functor category $\HomAkmat$
is an abelian category.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
We prove that $\HomAkmat$ is an Ab-category, then that it is also an additive category and a pre-abelian category and finally that
it is an abelian category.
\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelenumi}{(\theenumi)}
\item It is a pre-abelian category, which we showed in \ref{}.
\item 
\end{itemize}
\end{proof}
