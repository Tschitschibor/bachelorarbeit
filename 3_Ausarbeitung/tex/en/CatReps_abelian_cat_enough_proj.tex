Goal is to show that

CatReps is an abelian category with enough projectives (constructively) and direct sum decomposition (constructively).

\subsection{``Enough'' projectives? ``Some'' projectives?}
Stumbling across such vague concepts as in ``enough'' or ``some'' in a mathematical theory makes one wonder, what this is all about.
What are ``some''? How much is ``enough?
But as in the case of ``almost all'' (meaning ``all but finitely many'') which a first semester student might at first find equally strange, there
are \textit{some} precise definitions for these concepts.
