I would like to thank all the people who helped and supported me while working on this thesis.\\

I express my deep gratitude to my advisor Mohamed Barakat  who always had time for questions and problems and who helped me
with the structure of the thesis.\\

I want to thank Peter Webb for our interesting discussions and for introducing me to the topic of category representations.\\

Many thanks go to Sebastian Posur and Sebastian Gutsche for their software project \CAP as well as to all of the contributors to the \CAP project.\\

I also like to thank the many unnamed people answering questions online for \texttt{tikz} and \LaTeX. Among them I especially want to thank
Yichuan Shen for his \texttt{tikzcd-editor} which let me easily create every commutative diagram you see in this thesis.\\

Last, I would like to thank my family for providing me with a home and work atmosphere at a time where the university was closed.\\
